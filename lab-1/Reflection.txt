Programming in Python for this lab was a refreshing experience due to its clean syntax and readability. I appreciated Python's simplicity and the absence of unnecessary symbols, making code expression straightforward. List comprehensions proved handy for concise list creation, enhancing code elegance. The language's dynamic typing offered flexibility, reducing the need for explicit type declarations.

Unexpected behaviour was the case-sensitive nature of string comparison. To ensure consistent comparisons, converting strings to lowercase became necessary. Differences in memory management, type systems, and the impact on programming approaches stood out. Python's automatic memory management contrasted with C/C++'s manual approach, influencing code complexity. Python's high-level abstractions facilitated concise code, emphasizing problem-solving over low-level details.
